              After a year long period of turbulence and highly criticised lockdown

              , positive cases in England have stagnated since the sharp peak in January
              2021. With the decrease in cases, the Prime Minister implemented a roadmap
              which he hopes will signal the reintregration of the public back into
              normal life.

              <p>
                The NHS will contact you when it's time for you to have the
                coronavirus vaccination. More people are being offered the
                vaccine every week.
              </p>

              <h4>Appointment events</h4>
              <p>
                Once it is your turn to receive the vaccine, you will be invited
                by the NHS via a letter, phone call, email or text to a
                vaccination location. You will receive 2 doses of the vaccine
                and have to attend 2 appointments. The 1st dose of the vaccine
                should give you good protection from COVID-19. However, 2 doses
                are required for long lasting protection against the virus.
              </p>

              <p>
                On the day of yourappointment you will need to bring: a face
                covering (unless you cannot wear one for a health or disability
                reason) your booking reference numbers if your appointment is at
                a vaccination centre and a carer if needed.
              </p>

              <p>
                The appointment should last between 30 to 45 minutes. You will
                be asked some questions about your medical history. It's
                important to tell the staff giving you the vaccination if you
                have ever had a severe allergic reaction or if you are pregnant.
              </p>

              <p>
                Appointments at a vaccination centres will requrest the booking
                reference number on arrival. You will then be given an injection
                of the vaccine. There will be regular cleaning and social
                distancing in waiting areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the vaccination you may be asked to wait for 15 minutes.
                This is in the unlikely event you have a serious reaction to the
                vaccine. If this does happen, it usually happens within minutes.
                The team are trained to deal with reactions and treat them
                immediately. You will also be given a leaflet about what to
                expect after your vaccination to take home with you.

                advice about the coronavirus vaccine and certain health
                conditions. If you have a health condition or you are an adult
                care, this means you are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine and
